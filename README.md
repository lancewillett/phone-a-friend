`phone-a-friend` is a CLI orchestration layer for AI coding agents.
Relay tasks to any backend, spin up multi-model teams, or run persistent multi-agent sessions.

| Mode | What it does | Best for |
|------|-------------|----------|
| **Relay** | One-shot delegation to Antigravity, Codex, Gemini, Ollama, Claude, OpenCode, or xAI | Quick second opinions, code reviews, analysis |
| **Team** | Iterative multi-backend refinement over N rounds | Collaborative review, converging on a solution |
| **Agentic** | Persistent multi-agent sessions with @mention routing | Autonomous collaboration, adversarial review, deep analysis |

### Host parity

| Feature | Claude Code | OpenCode | Codex |
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| `/phone-a-friend` (single + parallel multi-backend relay) | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| `/curiosity-engine` (Q&A rally) | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| `/phone-a-team` (iterative multi-model team) | ✓ | — | ✓ |
| Plugin marketplace install | ✓ | — | ✓ |
| CLI plugin install (`phone-a-friend plugin install --<host>`) | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Skill auto-discovery | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Recursion guard (`PHONE_A_FRIEND_HOST=<host>`) | n/a | ✓ | ✓ |

Claude `/phone-a-team` orchestrates rounds with Agent Teams: the lead spawns named teammates through the Agent tool and coordinates them with SendMessage. It needs `CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS=1` in your settings `env` (teams are off by default) and shows one split pane per teammate when `teammateMode` is `"tmux"`; otherwise it falls back to direct relays in the lead session. On Claude, `/phone-a-friend` reviews run in the background through the plugin's `paf-reviewer` subagent, so they show up in the agent panel and come back as a receipt plus verbatim findings. Codex `/phone-a-team` is pure Bash orchestration directly from the skill body, with Codex's own model handling the synthesis between rounds. OpenCode has no comparable primitive and replicates `/phone-a-team` by running repeated `/phone-a-friend` calls manually.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Codex users:** Codex's default `workspace-write` sandbox blocks subprocess access to the macOS Keychain (where Claude stores OAuth tokens) and OAuth refresh network paths (Gemini and Antigravity). With the default sandbox, relays to Claude fail with a misleading `Not logged in` and Google CLI relays can hang until the timeout. Two workarounds today, both with tradeoffs:
>
> **Option A — Lower the sandbox.** Per-session (preferred): launch Codex with `codex --sandbox danger-full-access`. Persistent (convenient but removes sandbox protections from every Codex session, not just PaF relays): add an alias to `~/.zshrc` or `~/.bashrc`:
> ```bash
> alias codex='codex --sandbox danger-full-access'
> ```
>
> **Option B — Use API keys for API-key backends.** Skips OAuth entirely for Claude/Gemini CLI, works in any sandbox:
> ```bash
> export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=...
> export GEMINI_API_KEY=...
> ```
>
> A portable-auth path via `claude setup-token` is planned for the Claude side. Antigravity uses `agy` subscription auth, so the current Antigravity-safe path from Codex is Option A or running PaF from a regular terminal.

## Quick Start

**Prerequisites:** Node.js 22.13+ and at least one backend:

- [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/setup)
- [Google Antigravity CLI](https://antigravity.google/) (`agy`) for Google AI Pro/Ultra or consumer Google accounts
- [Codex CLI](https://developers.openai.com/codex/quickstart/)
- [Gemini CLI](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli) for API key, Vertex AI, or enterprise Gemini Code Assist flows
- [xAI](https://console.x.ai)
- [Ollama](https://ollama.com/download)
- [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai/docs)

**Install:**

```bash
npm install -g @freibergergarcia/phone-a-friend
phone-a-friend    # first run shows a guided menu — choose Setup
```

The setup wizard detects your backends, offers to install detected host integrations, and verifies everything works.

**Claude Code marketplace (commands and skills only):**

```
/plugin marketplace add freibergergarcia/phone-a-friend
/plugin install phone-a-friend@phone-a-friend-marketplace
```

To update: `/plugin marketplace update phone-a-friend-marketplace` then `/plugin update phone-a-friend@phone-a-friend-marketplace`.

> [!NOTE]
> Marketplace install ships only the slash commands and skills. For the full CLI (agentic mode and TUI), install via `npm install -g @freibergergarcia/phone-a-friend`.

**OpenCode commands and skills:**

If you use [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai/docs), install the same Phone-a-Friend skills plus thin slash-command shims into your OpenCode config:

```bash
phone-a-friend plugin install --opencode
```

This installs to `~/.config/opencode/skills/` and `~/.config/opencode/commands/` (or `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/opencode/...`). From OpenCode, ask naturally, for example:

```
Ask Codex through phone-a-friend for a short sanity review of this repo; do not edit files.
```

**Codex plugin (skills + marketplace registration):**

If you use [Codex CLI](https://developers.openai.com/codex/quickstart/), install the Phone-a-Friend plugin two ways:

Via the Codex marketplace (visible in `/plugins` like Claude):

```
codex plugin marketplace add freibergergarcia/phone-a-friend
codex plugin add phone-a-friend@phone-a-friend-marketplace
```

Or via the PaF CLI (does both the marketplace registration AND drops skills into `~/.codex/`):

```bash
phone-a-friend plugin install --codex
```

This installs `phone-a-friend`, `curiosity-engine`, and `phone-a-team` skills into `$CODEX_HOME/skills/` (defaulting to `~/.codex/skills/`). All three are orchestrated through pure Bash from the skill bodies — no Codex subagent primitive is required.

> [!NOTE]
> Unlike Claude's marketplace, Codex marketplace install ships the skills directly — `codex plugin marketplace add` + `codex plugin add` is sufficient to use `/phone-a-friend`, `/curiosity-engine`, and `/phone-a-team` from inside Codex. For the full CLI (TUI and agentic mode), install via `npm install -g @freibergergarcia/phone-a-friend`. Running `phone-a-friend plugin install --codex` after the npm install additionally drops loose-file skills under `~/.codex/skills/` as a no-marketplace fallback.

From Codex, ask naturally:

```
Ask Claude and Gemini through phone-a-friend what they think of this code.

Use phone-a-team across Claude and Gemini to converge on a fix for this auth bug. Three rounds max.
```

**From source:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/freibergergarcia/phone-a-friend.git
cd phone-a-friend
npm install && npm run build
./dist/index.js   # first run guides you through setup
```

Then from Claude Code or OpenCode, just talk naturally — the host integration loads the skills automatically:

```
Ask Gemini to review the error handling in relay.ts

Spin up Codex and Gemini to review the docs.
Then spin another agent to review their reviews and report back.

Build a team with Claude and Ollama. Have them review the website copy,
loop through 3 rounds, and converge on final suggestions.
```

No slash commands needed once the host integration is installed (see [Host parity](#host-parity) for which slash commands work in which host).

> [!TIP]
> **Claude Code power-user setup:** Run in [**tmux**](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/tmux) with [**bypass permissions**](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/security) (`⏵⏵`) and [**Agent Teams**](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/agent-teams) to watch agents work in parallel split panes. Pair with **phone-a-friend agentic mode** for fully autonomous sessions.

## CLI Usage

### Relay

Delegate a task to any backend and get the result back:

```bash
phone-a-friend --to codex --prompt "Review this code"
phone-a-friend --to antigravity --prompt "Review this code" --sandbox read-only
phone-a-friend --to gemini --prompt "Analyze the architecture"
phone-a-friend --to claude --prompt "Refactor this module"
phone-a-friend --to ollama --prompt "Explain this function"
phone-a-friend --to opencode --prompt "Audit this repo" --model qwen3-coder  # Local agentic (OpenCode + Ollama)
phone-a-friend --to claude --prompt "Review this code" --stream   # Stream tokens live
phone-a-friend --to codex --prompt "Audit the auth module" --quiet # Run silently, save result
phone-a-friend --to codex --review --no-task-history            # Skip the local task record
phone-a-friend --to opencode --prompt "Explain this" --fast        # Skip OpenCode plugins (faster)
phone-a-friend --to codex --prompt "Review my fix" --include-diff   # Append `git diff HEAD` to the prompt
phone-a-friend --to codex --prompt "Quick question" --no-include-diff  # Override defaults.include_diff = true
phone-a-friend --to claude --prompt "Coordinate with the migration session" --peer-messaging accept
```

### Structured output

Request JSON responses matching a schema:

```bash
phone-a-friend --to codex --prompt "List files that need refactoring" \
  --schema '{"type":"object","properties":{"files":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}}},"required":["files"],"additionalProperties":false}'
```

Claude, Codex, and Ollama enforce the schema through their native structured-output surfaces. Antigravity, Gemini, xAI, and OpenCode CLI use prompt injection (best-effort), with PaF validating built-in verdict envelopes before returning them.

Codex also receives the schema on follow-ups through `--session` or
`--backend-session`. PaF checks `codex exec resume --help` using the invocation's
PATH before a schema-bearing resume. Unsupported or failed checks stop before
model execution with an actionable error; plain resumes do not need this probe.

### Sessions

Resume previous relay conversations for multi-turn workflows:

```bash
phone-a-friend --to codex --prompt "Review the auth module" --session auth-review
# Later, continue the conversation:
phone-a-friend --to codex --prompt "Now fix those issues" --session auth-review
```

Sessions work reliably with Claude, Codex, Gemini, and OpenCode. Ollama and xAI replay history (may hit token limits on long conversations). Antigravity is one-shot only in this release, so `--session` is rejected for `--to antigravity`.

### Claude peer messaging

On supported macOS and Linux setups, Claude Code 2.1.224+ can list and message
other live Claude Code sessions on the same machine. PaF exposes that
capability deliberately for Claude relays:

```bash
# Use Claude's native inbound policy while allowing peer discovery/messages (default)
phone-a-friend --to claude --prompt "Ask the payments session for its status" \
  --peer-messaging native --session payments-coordinator

# Deliver peer messages to the unattended PaF worker immediately
phone-a-friend --to claude --prompt "Coordinate the migration" \
  --peer-messaging accept --session migration-coordinator

# Isolate this relay from peer messaging in both directions
phone-a-friend --to claude --prompt "Review privately" --peer-messaging refuse
```

`native` is the default: PaF makes `ListAgents` and `SendMessage` available but
leaves inbound delivery to Claude Code's own permission-mode rules. `accept`
sets `crossSessionInbound` to `accept`, which is the autonomy-first choice for
unattended workers. `refuse` rejects inbound messages and removes the peer
tools. Peer-visible workers are named from the PaF session label, such as
`paf-migration-coordinator`; one-shot relays use `paf-relay`.

Set your preferred mode once:

```bash
phone-a-friend config set backends.claude.peer_messaging accept
```

On Claude Code 2.1.236+, the main session can request a one-shot idle notice
with `SendMessage`'s `notify_when_idle`. An idle notice is not a completed-review
verdict; inspect the result. See [peer notifications](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/cross-session-messaging#get-a-notice-when-another-session-goes-idle).

### Job tracking

The `--quiet` flag saves the result to a local job store for later retrieval:

```bash
phone-a-friend --to codex --prompt "Review this" --quiet   # Waits for completion and stores the result
phone-a-friend job status                                    # List all jobs
phone-a-friend job result <id>                               # Show stored output
phone-a-friend job cancel <id>                               # Mark a pending/running job cancelled
```

`--quiet` does not detach the process. `job cancel` updates stored status; it does not terminate the backend subprocess.

### Task tracking

Every relay and review is recorded as a task in `~/.config/phone-a-friend/tasks.db`, so you can find delegated work from another terminal or after your host conversation has moved on:

```bash
phone-a-friend --to codex --review --review-scope working-tree
#   ◇ Task 3f9a2c1d started · phone-a-friend task show 3f9a2c1d   (stderr)
phone-a-friend task list --repo .            # Newest tasks for this repository
phone-a-friend task show 3f9a                # Scope, backend session, drift check, event log (prefix ok)
phone-a-friend task result 3f9a2c1d          # Stored result; exit 3 while still running
phone-a-friend task prune --older-than 30    # Housekeeping (--all drops everything)
```

Reviews hash the collected diff before the backend starts and re-check it afterwards. If the working tree changed during the review, PaF says so on stderr and marks the task, because the result covers the original snapshot only. Codex reviews stream progress events (commands run, messages) into the task log; other backends record lifecycle events only, and a quiet task is not a stuck one.

Retention is a setting: `defaults.task_history = "results"` (default) keeps the result text plus a short prompt preview and hashes, `"metadata"` drops the text, `"off"` records nothing. `PHONE_A_FRIEND_TASK_HISTORY` overrides the config and `--no-task-history` skips one run. Deleting a task never deletes the backend's own session.

From Claude Code, the `/phone-a-friend` skill runs reviews as background shell tasks so you can keep working; the result returns to the conversation when the command exits, and the task record is the fallback when that context is gone.

While a relay runs, PaF reports progress on stderr: one line per backend-reported event when stderr is not a terminal (`◇ 00:12 Running: git diff`), or folded into the spinner text when it is. Every run ends with a receipt such as `◇ Task 3f9a2c1d completed · 23s · scope unchanged`.

#### Status line

`phone-a-friend task status-line` prints one row for the repository your Claude Code session is in: `◇ codex review 00:45 · Running: git diff` while a task runs, then `◇ codex review done 40s ago · tree unchanged` for two minutes, then nothing. It reads Claude Code's status line JSON on stdin, so it drops straight into `settings.json`:

```json
{
  "statusLine": {
    "type": "command",
    "command": "phone-a-friend task status-line",
    "refreshInterval": 5
  }
}
```

If you already have a status line script, feed both commands the same stdin from a small wrapper:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
input=$(cat)
printf '%s' "$input" | bash ~/.claude/my-statusline.sh
printf '%s' "$input" | phone-a-friend task status-line
```

It prints nothing when no task is running or finished within the last two minutes (`--recent <minutes>` changes the window), so the row only appears when there is something to say. It deliberately omits the task id; `phone-a-friend task list --repo .` has it.

### Review

Context-aware code reviews collect an explicit Git scope so you don't have to paste code:

```bash
phone-a-friend --to claude --review                           # Committed branch changes (default)
phone-a-friend --to codex --review --review-scope working-tree # Staged, unstaged, and untracked
phone-a-friend --to opencode --review --review-scope all       # Branch plus working-tree changes
phone-a-friend --to codex --review --base develop              # Use a specific comparison branch
```

| `--review-scope` | Included changes |
|---|---|
| `branch` (default) | Committed changes from the merge base with `--base` through `HEAD` |
| `working-tree` | Staged, unstaged, and non-ignored untracked files relative to `HEAD` |
| `all` | Branch changes plus staged, unstaged, and non-ignored untracked files |

Pass a repository root, linked Git worktree, or any directory inside one through
`--repo <path>`; review mode normalizes it to the containing worktree root before
collecting changes. Before the first commit, `working-tree` and `all` compare
pending files against Git's empty tree. PaF collects and bounds the selected
scope before any native or generic backend call, so the normal diff size limit
always applies. When PaF supplies a generic diff, untracked binary files use a
binary-change marker instead of raw bytes.

If the selected scope is clean, PaF does not invoke a backend. Plain review
returns `No changes found for review scope "<scope>".`; `--verdict-json` returns
a valid `abstain` envelope with no findings. Native review is used only when the
backend supports the selected non-empty scope; otherwise PaF supplies the
deterministic diff through the generic path.

`--include-diff` remains available for normal prompt mode. It cannot be combined with review mode; select `working-tree` or `all` instead. To override a `defaults.include_diff = true` config setting on a normal relay, use `--no-include-diff` (or set `PHONE_A_FRIEND_INCLUDE_DIFF=false` in the environment for older binaries).

> [!TIP]
> Don't paste code into `--prompt` just to review it — the backend can read the repo directly via `--repo "$PWD"` (default: current working directory). Pasting risks leaking uncommitted edits and burns tokens for content the backend can fetch itself.

### Agentic

Spawn multiple agents that collaborate via @mentions (see [Agentic Mode](#agentic-mode) below):

```bash
phone-a-friend agentic run --agents reviewer:claude,critic:claude --prompt "Review this code"
phone-a-friend agentic logs               # View past sessions
phone-a-friend agentic replay --session <id>  # Replay transcript
```

Agentic mode currently supports Claude only. Other native-session backends
(Codex, Gemini, OpenCode) are rejected rather than routed to Claude; their normal
relay mode remains available. Agentic errors produce a nonzero CLI exit code.
Timeouts and turn caps with pending work are saved as failed with their end reason,
and return a nonzero exit code. Partial output from failed agents remains in the
transcript. Stop and timeout cancel in-flight calls; on POSIX, PaF terminates their
process groups and waits for shutdown before closing the event stream.

`--sandbox` sets Claude's tool policy on both initial and resumed calls:
read-only allows read/search tools, workspace-write adds Edit/Write, and
danger-full-access bypasses permissions. This is tool policy, not OS isolation.

Relay labels and history use `~/.config/phone-a-friend/sessions.db`. SQLite
transactions preserve concurrent team writes. The first access imports existing
`sessions.json` once and leaves valid JSON as a recovery copy. Use the same PaF
version for session writes after migration: older binaries still write JSON.

### Ops

```bash
phone-a-friend                 # Interactive TUI dashboard (TTY only)
phone-a-friend setup           # Guided setup wizard
phone-a-friend doctor          # Health check all backends + host install status
phone-a-friend plugin install --claude    # Install Claude Code plugin
phone-a-friend plugin install --opencode  # Install OpenCode commands and skills
phone-a-friend plugin install --codex     # Install Codex skills
phone-a-friend config show     # Show resolved config
phone-a-friend config edit     # Open in $EDITOR
```

`doctor` reports CLI backends, local backends (Ollama), API backends (xAI; key presence only), host integration status (Claude / OpenCode / Codex plugin install state), and a summary count. Antigravity and OpenCode CLI are treated as optional: if you don't have `agy` or OpenCode installed, doctor will show them but will not flag that as a degraded state.

`doctor --json` also reports each CLI's selected executable, version, and other
PATH candidates. It distinguishes the running PaF build from the PATH install,
configured models from unknown backend-reported models, and adapter-declared
capabilities from runtime verification. Version probes are bounded and never
request model inference. If a relay behaves differently from your host app,
compare these paths and versions before changing authentication or upgrading.

### Update notifications

phone-a-friend checks the npm registry for newer stable releases at most once
every 24 hours and prints a one-time stderr banner the next time it runs in an
interactive terminal. The current invocation is never slowed down: the registry
fetch happens in the background, with results applied on the next run.

Sample banner:

```
  ↑ phone-a-friend X.Y.Z available (current: A.B.C)
    Run: npm install -g @freibergergarcia/phone-a-friend@latest
```

The banner is suppressed automatically when:
- stdout or stderr is not a TTY (piped or redirected output)
- `CI` is set, or `TERM=dumb`
- the command uses `--quiet`, `--schema`, `--verdict-json`, or any subcommand-level `--json` flag
- the same version was already shown within the last 7 days

To disable update checks entirely:

```bash
# One-off
PHONE_A_FRIEND_UPDATE_CHECK=false phone-a-friend ...

# Permanent
phone-a-friend config set defaults.update_check false
```

The cache lives at `~/.config/phone-a-friend/update-check.json` (or under
`$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` if set). Run `phone-a-friend doctor` to inspect the current
state.

## Backends

| Backend | Type | Streaming |
|---------|------|-----------|
| **Antigravity** | CLI subprocess (`agy`) | No |
| **Codex** | CLI subprocess | No |
| **Gemini** | CLI subprocess | No |
| **Ollama** | HTTP API | Yes (NDJSON) |
| **Claude** | CLI subprocess | Yes (JSON) |
| **OpenCode** | CLI subprocess | Yes (NDJSON) |
| **xAI** | Responses HTTP API | No |

Ollama configuration via environment variables:
- `OLLAMA_HOST` -- custom host (default: `http://localhost:11434`)
- `OLLAMA_MODEL` -- default model (overridden by `--model` flag)

Claude configuration via TOML:

```toml
[backends.claude]
peer_messaging = "native" # native (default), accept, or refuse
```

Phone-a-friend environment variables:
- `PHONE_A_FRIEND_INCLUDE_DIFF=false` -- disable diff inclusion globally (equivalent to `--no-include-diff` on every call).
- `PHONE_A_FRIEND_CLAUDE_PEER_MESSAGING=native|accept|refuse` -- override Claude peer messaging for the current process.
- `PHONE_A_FRIEND_HOST=opencode|codex` -- mark the calling process as a specific host for the recursion guard. `opencode` blocks `--to opencode`; `codex` blocks `--to codex`. Set automatically by the install shims.
- `CODEX_HOME` -- override the Codex config root (default: `~/.codex`). Honored by the Codex skill installer.
- `PHONE_A_FRIEND_GEMINI_DEAD_CACHE=false` -- bypass the Gemini dead-model cache (debugging stale entries).

Antigravity notes:
- PaF backend name: `antigravity`; executable: `agy`.
- Antigravity is read-only only for now. Plain `--to antigravity` calls resolve
  to `read-only`; explicit write sandboxes such as `--sandbox workspace-write`
  are rejected.
- `--session` and `--backend-session` are not supported yet.
- If Gemini CLI says individual Google sign-in is no longer supported, use `--to antigravity` for the Google subscription path or use Gemini CLI with an API key/Vertex flow.

xAI:

```bash
phone-a-friend --to xai --prompt "Find recent X discussions with sources"
```

Requires `XAI_API_KEY` from https://console.x.ai.
Web and X search are always on.
Answers end with a `Sources:` list when cited; schema mode omits it.

OpenCode configuration via TOML:
```toml
[backends.opencode]
provider = "ollama"     # model prefix (default: "ollama")
model = "qwen3-coder"   # default model
pure = false             # skip OpenCode plugins (maps to --fast)
```

## Streaming

Backends that support streaming deliver tokens as they arrive via `--stream`:

```bash
phone-a-friend --to claude --prompt "Review this code" --stream
```

Streaming is enabled by default in the config (`defaults.stream = true`). Disable with `--no-stream` or `config set defaults.stream false`.

## Agentic Mode

> Let one agent review while another critiques — catching bugs, inconsistencies, and blind spots before you even see the code.

Agentic mode spawns multiple Claude agents that communicate via `@mentions` within a shared session. An orchestrator routes messages between agents, enforces guardrails, and persists the transcript for logs, replay, and TUI browsing.

Each agent accumulates context through persistent CLI sessions — later responses build on earlier ones, so agents develop genuine understanding of the problem as the session progresses.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Agentic mode currently supports Claude agents only.** Codex, Gemini, OpenCode, Ollama, and xAI agents are not yet wired into the orchestrator. If you need multi-host adversarial review today, use `/phone-a-team` instead — it does parallel multi-backend rounds with the same iterate-or-ship pattern, just without the persistent session graph. See [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) for the agentic architecture.

```bash
# Start an agentic session
phone-a-friend agentic run \
  --agents reviewer:claude,critic:claude \
  --prompt "Review the auth module"

# View past sessions and replay transcripts
phone-a-friend agentic logs
phone-a-friend agentic replay --session <id>
```

**What you get:**

- **Persistent sessions** -- agents accumulate context across turns via UUID-based session resumption
- **@mention routing** -- agents address each other by name (`@ada.reviewer:`), broadcast with `@all`, or surface findings with `@user`
- **Guardrails** -- max turns (20), ping-pong detection, session timeout (15 min), turn budget warnings
- **Full audit trail** -- SQLite-backed transcript persistence for replay, logs, and post-session analysis
- **Creative agent naming** -- agents get memorable human names so you can follow the conversation

## Uninstall

**npm install:**

```bash
npm uninstall -g @freibergergarcia/phone-a-friend
```

Automatically removes the Claude Code plugin (CLI-installed), OpenCode commands and skills, Codex skills, and the `~/.config/phone-a-friend` directory (config, sessions, jobs).

> [!WARNING]
> `npm uninstall -g` deletes `~/.config/phone-a-friend` entirely, including persisted session labels, the background job store, and agentic transcripts. Back up anything you want to keep before uninstalling. The agentic SQLite database at `~/.config/phone-a-friend/agentic.db` and any local config in `~/.config/phone-a-friend/config.toml` are wiped along with it.

**Claude Code marketplace:**

```
/plugin uninstall phone-a-friend@phone-a-friend-marketplace
/plugin marketplace remove phone-a-friend-marketplace
```

4. PRs are **squash-merged** (one commit per change, clean linear history)
5. Head branches are auto-deleted after merge
6. On merge, version is **auto-bumped** based on the label

**Branch prefixes:**

| Prefix | Label |
|--------|-------|
| `fix/`, `bugfix/` | `patch` |
| `chore/`, `docs/`, `ci/`, `refactor/` | `patch` |
| `feat/`, `feature/` | `minor` |
| `breaking/` | `major` |

Unrecognized prefixes require adding `patch`, `minor`, or `major` manually.

## Development

```bash
npm install              # Install dependencies
npm run build            # Build dist/ (tsup)
npm test                 # Run tests (vitest)
npm run typecheck        # Type check (tsc --noEmit)
```

### Test a checkout end to end

Host skills call whatever `phone-a-friend` is on `PATH`, and the marketplace
manifest sources the Claude plugin from npm, so a fresh Claude session will
run the released version even when you are sitting in a modified checkout.
To exercise unreleased changes:

```bash
npm run build && npm link          # global `phone-a-friend` now points at this checkout
phone-a-friend doctor              # confirms PATH resolves to the checkout, no version mismatch
claude --plugin-dir "$PWD"         # loads this checkout's commands/ and skills/ for the session,
                                   # overriding the installed marketplace copy
```

Then ask for a review in that session. `npm install -g @freibergergarcia/phone-a-friend`
restores the released binary. `phone-a-friend plugin install --claude` alone is not
enough for skill changes: it re-registers the marketplace, whose plugin source is npm.

## Privacy

Phone a Friend does not collect, transmit, or store any data on servers operated by this project. There is no telemetry and no analytics.

Prompts and repository context are passed only to backends you have configured yourself: the Claude, Codex, Gemini, Antigravity, and OpenCode CLIs, a local Ollama instance, or the xAI Responses API using your `XAI_API_KEY`. Each backend is governed by its own provider's privacy policy and terms.

Local state (config, sessions, jobs, and agentic transcripts) is written only to `~/.config/phone-a-friend/` on your machine.
