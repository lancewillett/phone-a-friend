description: Ask another model for a second opinion through Phone-a-Friend.
---

Use the `phone-a-friend` skill with this exact user request:

$ARGUMENTS

OpenCode-specific execution rules:

- Run inside OpenCode means the current process IS OpenCode. Do not select
  `opencode` as the friend backend — PaF blocks that with a recursion guard.
  Choose `antigravity`, `codex`, `gemini`, `claude`, `ollama`, or `xai` instead.
- Prefix every relay invocation with `PHONE_A_FRIEND_HOST=opencode` so the
  recursion guard fires deterministically (the install shims set this for
  you, but be explicit when constructing commands).
- Always prefix relay invocations with `PHONE_A_FRIEND_INCLUDE_DIFF=false`
  to suppress the working-tree diff. This env var works on every shipped
  PaF binary (v1.7.2 and later). Do not pass `--no-include-diff` as a
  CLI flag — older binaries reject it with `unknown option`.
- Preserve the user's request in `--prompt`. Do not run a bare
  `phone-a-friend --to <backend> --review` unless the user explicitly asked
  to review the current diff or branch changes.
- For relay prompts built from user text or model output, write the prompt
  to a temp file with a single-quoted heredoc first; do not inline dynamic
  text inside double-quoted shell arguments.

Example (sanity-review prompt mode):

```bash
PROMPT_FILE="$(mktemp)"
trap 'rm -f "$PROMPT_FILE"' EXIT
cat > "$PROMPT_FILE" <<'PAF_PROMPT_EOF'
$ARGUMENTS
PAF_PROMPT_EOF

PHONE_A_FRIEND_HOST=opencode PHONE_A_FRIEND_INCLUDE_DIFF=false \
  phone-a-friend --to codex --repo "$PWD" \
  --prompt "$(cat "$PROMPT_FILE")" --timeout 300 --no-stream --fast
```

Defer to the canonical `phone-a-friend` skill for workflow details, Gemini
model selection, and session continuity.
