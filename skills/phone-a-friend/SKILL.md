# /phone-a-friend

Use this skill after an assistant reply you want reviewed by another AI.

## Goal

Send compact task context + the latest assistant reply to a backend (Antigravity, Codex, Gemini, Claude, OpenCode, Ollama, or xAI) using `phone-a-friend`, then bring the feedback back into the current conversation.

## Execution rules

- Preserve the user's actual request in `--prompt`. Do not drop it.
- Do not run a bare `phone-a-friend --to <backend> --review` unless the user
  explicitly asks to review the current diff, branch changes, or staged changes.
- For code review, map the requested surface explicitly: `branch` for committed
  branch changes, `working-tree` for staged/unstaged/untracked files, and `all`
  when both are in scope.
- If the user asks for a repo sanity check, architecture opinion, plan critique,
  or general second opinion, use normal prompt mode with `--repo "$PWD"`.
- If the user says not to edit files, keep that instruction in `--prompt`.
- From OpenCode, do not select `opencode` as the friend backend. Choose
  `antigravity`, `codex`, `gemini`, `claude`, `ollama`, or `xai`.
- From Codex, do not select `codex` as the friend backend. Choose `claude`,
  `antigravity`, `gemini`, `opencode`, `ollama`, or `xai`. PaF enforces this with the same
  `PHONE_A_FRIEND_HOST` recursion guard used for OpenCode.
- Suppress the working-tree diff by default (see "Diff suppression" below);
  only include the diff when the user explicitly asked for a
  diff/branch/staged review.
- One backend per call. Never pass comma-separated values to `--to` (e.g.
  `phone-a-friend --to codex,gemini`). To consult multiple models, run
  separate `phone-a-friend` calls. In Claude Code and Codex, `/phone-a-team`
  orchestrates those calls using the host-specific skill. In OpenCode, run
  separate invocations yourself; `/phone-a-team` is not installed there.
- `curiosity-engine` is a host slash command / Agent Skill, not a PaF CLI
  subcommand. Never run `phone-a-friend curiosity-engine`. Same shape rule
  applies to any other slash command: never invoke them as PaF
  subcommands (e.g. `phone-a-friend phone-a-team`).
- `--backend` is a `/phone-a-team` skill argument (Claude Code and Codex), not a PaF
  CLI flag. Do not pass `--backend` to `phone-a-friend`.
- When running inside OpenCode, always prefix relay invocations with
  `PHONE_A_FRIEND_HOST=opencode` (recursion guard) AND
  `PHONE_A_FRIEND_INCLUDE_DIFF=false` (diff suppression that works on
  every shipped binary version). Do NOT use the `$PAF_NO_DIFF`
  probe-and-gate pattern from OpenCode — small host models skip the
  probe and inline `--no-include-diff` literally, which fails on stale
  CLIs. The probe-and-gate is reserved for the rich orchestrator path
  (Claude Code / capable orchestrators).
- When running inside Codex, prefix relay invocations with
  `PHONE_A_FRIEND_HOST=codex` (recursion guard). Codex ships modern
  PaF binaries, so the `--no-include-diff` flag works directly; the
  env-var fallback is also fine if you prefer symmetry with OpenCode.
- When materializing relay commands, write dynamic prompt/context text into
  temp files using single-quoted heredocs. Do not splice user text, prior
  model output, or conversation context into double-quoted shell arguments.
- Do NOT dump repo files or git output into `--context-file` or
  `--context-text`. Repo-aware backends read files via `--repo "$PWD"`
  using their own tools. See "Context hygiene" below.

For example, from OpenCode:

```bash
PHONE_A_FRIEND_HOST=opencode PHONE_A_FRIEND_INCLUDE_DIFF=false \
  phone-a-friend --to codex --repo "$PWD" \
  --prompt "Give a short sanity review of this repo. Do not edit files." \
  --timeout 300 --no-stream --fast
```

## Inputs

- Review focus (optional): `$ARGUMENTS`

## Host awareness

PaF blocks accidental host recursion (e.g.
`OpenCode -> phone-a-friend --to opencode -> OpenCode`,
`Codex -> phone-a-friend --to codex -> Codex`) using the
`PHONE_A_FRIEND_HOST` environment marker.

When running from OpenCode, always set `PHONE_A_FRIEND_HOST=opencode` on
every relay invocation. From Codex, set `PHONE_A_FRIEND_HOST=codex`. The
install shims set the marker automatically; be explicit when constructing
commands by hand. From Claude Code, the marker is not needed.

When running from OpenCode, do not select `opencode` as the friend backend.
Choose `antigravity`, `codex`, `gemini`, `claude`, `ollama`, or `xai`.

When running from Codex, do not select `codex` as the friend backend. Choose
`claude`, `antigravity`, `gemini`, `opencode`, `ollama`, or `xai`.

## Relay mode

```bash
command -v phone-a-friend
```

- If found: set `RELAY_MODE = binary`
- If not found: set `RELAY_MODE = direct`

No hard abort. The skill continues either way.

**Always resolve the binary via `command -v phone-a-friend`.** Never invoke `./phone-a-friend` from the current working directory, even when you are working inside the phone-a-friend repository itself. The repo's `./phone-a-friend` script is a development entry point that may be out of sync with the user's installed version, and assuming it exists will fail every time you are run from anywhere else. Capture the path once and reuse it:

```bash
RELAY_BIN="$(command -v phone-a-friend)"
# Then every relay invocation uses "$RELAY_BIN" ... — never plain "phone-a-friend"
# from PATH lookup and never "./phone-a-friend".
```

## Codex sandbox and installation diagnosis

When a relay fails with an authentication error or timeout, first run
`"$RELAY_BIN" doctor --json` and check the selected backend executable/version.
The host app, PATH-installed PaF, and a checkout build can use different installs.
Doctor reports configured models; it does not establish account/model access.

A Codex host's sandbox may restrict network or keychain access. Compare the same
backend command, executable, and auth profile in a regular terminal before
classifying the failure. A login error or timeout alone does not prove a sandbox
problem or invalidate the user's credentials.

Keep PaF's read-only default. If sandbox restrictions are confirmed, use the
host's authorized command escalation or a separately authorized terminal run.
`--full-auto` is not equivalent to `--sandbox danger-full-access`; do not suggest
it as a keychain/network bypass. Changing sandbox permissions and switching to
API-key billing are separate user decisions, not automatic remediation.

Report the failing executable, error category, and next diagnostic step. Redact
credential-like values from errors and stop automatic retries on auth failures.

### Direct call reference

When `RELAY_MODE = direct`, call backend CLIs directly instead of using the
`phone-a-friend` binary:

| Backend | Direct command |
|---------|---------------|
| **Antigravity** | `agy --add-dir "$PWD" --print-timeout 300s --sandbox --mode plan --prompt "$(cat "$PROMPT_FILE")"` |
| **Codex** | `codex exec -C "$PWD" --skip-git-repo-check --sandbox read-only "$(cat "$PROMPT_FILE")" < /dev/null` |
| **Gemini** | `gemini --sandbox --yolo --include-directories "$PWD" --output-format text -m <model> --prompt "$(cat "$PROMPT_FILE")"` |

In direct mode, build `PROMPT_FILE` from prompt + context using this
template and the quoted-heredoc rule:

```
You are helping another coding agent by reviewing or advising on work in a local repository.
Repository path: <repo-path>
Use the repository files for context when needed.
Respond with concise, actionable feedback.

Request:
<relay-prompt>

Additional Context:
<context-payload>
```

In direct mode, also verify the backend CLI is available (`command -v agy`,
`command -v codex`, or `command -v gemini`) before calling it. If not found,
tell the user how to install it and stop. If Gemini CLI reports that
individual Google sign-in is no longer supported, switch to
`phone-a-friend --to antigravity` in binary mode or use Gemini CLI with an
API key/Vertex flow.

Note: do NOT pass PaF flags like `--no-include-diff`, `--fast`, or
`--session` in direct mode. They are CLI flags on the `phone-a-friend`
binary; the underlying backend CLIs do not accept them.

## Context hygiene

Do not generate `--context-file` or `--context-text` from repository files,
`git show`, `git diff`, `git status`, or other local file/git output. Do
not create temp files just to pass repo content. For repo-aware backends
(antigravity, codex, gemini, claude, opencode), pass `--repo "$PWD"` and let the
backend inspect files with its own tools.

`--context-file` and `--context-text` are reserved for **narrative
context that is not already in the repo** — for example: conversation
history that the backend cannot see, your own analysis, user constraints,
prior model output you want reviewed. These remain valid and useful.

Inlining repo content is wasteful, can leak tracked uncommitted edits or
committed secrets into the relay payload, and bypasses the backend's
normal file-access controls.

Backend exceptions: `ollama` and `xai` have `localFileAccess: false` and cannot read
the repo themselves. For either backend, ask the user before sending
file content, and send a minimal excerpt rather than bulk-dumping files
or git output.

## Diff suppression

PaF reads `defaults.include_diff` from user config. If a user has
`include_diff = true` set, every relay would silently leak the working-tree
diff into the prompt. Suppress the diff explicitly on every binary-mode
relay.

The cleanest flag is `--no-include-diff`, added in phone-a-friend v2.2.0.
Older binaries reject the flag with `unknown option '--no-include-diff'`.
Probe once at the start of the workflow, then reuse the gate:

```bash
if phone-a-friend relay --help 2>/dev/null | grep -q -- '--no-include-diff'; then
  PAF_NO_DIFF="--no-include-diff"
else
  export PHONE_A_FRIEND_INCLUDE_DIFF=false
  PAF_NO_DIFF=""
fi
```

Append `$PAF_NO_DIFF` to every binary-mode `phone-a-friend` invocation. The
env var fallback works in v1.7.2 and later; the explicit flag is preferred
when available.

When the user explicitly asks for code review, use `--review` and select
`--review-scope branch|working-tree|all` from the requested surface. Use
`--include-diff` only for a normal prompt-mode relay, never with review mode.

Probe `phone-a-friend relay --help` for `--review-scope` before the first such
call. On an older binary, a branch review may omit the scope flag. A
`working-tree` or `all` review requires the newer CLI; report the upgrade need
instead of silently falling back because legacy `--include-diff` omits
untracked files and cannot represent the combined scope.

Review mode normalizes `--repo` to the containing Git worktree root and supports
`working-tree`/`all` before the first commit. A clean selected scope never calls
the backend: plain mode returns `No changes found for review scope "<scope>".`,
while `--verdict-json` returns `abstain` with no findings. Treat that envelope as
"nothing to review", not as model uncertainty that should be retried.

## Workflow

1. Identify:
   - The latest relevant user request.
   - The most recent assistant reply to review.
2. Build relay prompt:
   - If `$ARGUMENTS` is non-empty: `Review this response in context and provide your opinion. Focus: $ARGUMENTS`
   - Otherwise: `Review this response in context and provide your opinion. Focus on correctness, risks, and missing assumptions.`
3. Build context payload:

```text
Task Context:
<latest relevant user request>

Assistant Response:
<latest assistant reply>

Review Request:
I'm working on this task and got the above response. Please review it and return:
1) Verdict: agree / partly agree / disagree
2) Corrections or risks
3) A revised concise answer
```

4. Run:

   **Binary mode** (`RELAY_MODE = binary`):
   ```bash
   RELAY_BIN="$(command -v phone-a-friend)"
   PROMPT_FILE="$(mktemp)"
   CONTEXT_FILE="$(mktemp)"
   trap 'rm -f "$PROMPT_FILE" "$CONTEXT_FILE"' EXIT

   cat > "$PROMPT_FILE" <<'PAF_PROMPT_EOF'
<relay-prompt>
PAF_PROMPT_EOF

   cat > "$CONTEXT_FILE" <<'PAF_CONTEXT_EOF'
<context-payload>
PAF_CONTEXT_EOF

   "$RELAY_BIN" --to codex --repo "$PWD" --prompt "$(cat "$PROMPT_FILE")" --context-file "$CONTEXT_FILE" $PAF_NO_DIFF [--fast] [--session <id>]
   # Antigravity is read-only and one-shot; do not add --session.
   "$RELAY_BIN" --to antigravity --repo "$PWD" --sandbox read-only --prompt "$(cat "$PROMPT_FILE")" --context-file "$CONTEXT_FILE" $PAF_NO_DIFF [--fast]
   # For gemini, omit --model by default (let auto-routing pick); see "Gemini model selection" below.
   # Gemini supports --session via native resume (see "Session continuity" below):
   "$RELAY_BIN" --to gemini --repo "$PWD" --prompt "$(cat "$PROMPT_FILE")" --context-file "$CONTEXT_FILE" $PAF_NO_DIFF [--fast] [--session <id>]
   ```

   Use delimiter names that do not appear in the payload. The quoted heredoc
   marker (`<<'PAF_PROMPT_EOF'`) is intentional: it makes shell treat the
   body as data, not executable text.

   `$PAF_NO_DIFF` comes from the probe in "Diff suppression" above. For code
   review, use `--review --review-scope branch|working-tree|all` based on the
   requested surface. Use `--include-diff` only for normal prompt mode.

   See "Speed optimization" and "Session continuity" below for when to
   include `--fast` and `--session`.

   **Direct mode** (`RELAY_MODE = direct`):
   ```bash
   # Antigravity:
   agy --add-dir "$PWD" --print-timeout 300s --sandbox --mode plan --prompt "$(cat "$PROMPT_FILE")"
   # Codex:
   codex exec -C "$PWD" --skip-git-repo-check --sandbox read-only "$(cat "$PROMPT_FILE")" < /dev/null
   # Gemini (omit -m for auto-routing; pin only when reproducibility/capability is needed):
   gemini --sandbox --yolo --include-directories "$PWD" --output-format text --prompt "$(cat "$PROMPT_FILE")"
   ```

   In direct mode, build `PROMPT_FILE` from the template in the "Direct call
   reference" section using the same quoted-heredoc rule, substituting
   `<relay-prompt>` and `<context-payload>` into the file body.

   Note: `--fast`, `--session`, and `--no-include-diff` are PaF CLI flags
   only available in binary mode. Do not append them to direct-mode
   invocations of `agy`, `codex`, or `gemini`.

5. Return backend feedback in concise review format:
   - Critical issues
   - Important issues
   - Suggested fixes

## Speed optimization

When building binary-mode relay commands, add `--fast` if ALL of these are true:

- The relay prompt is self-contained (all needed context is in `--prompt`
  and/or `--context-text`)
- The task does NOT reference project conventions, coding standards, or
  CLAUDE.md rules that the backend needs to read
- The task does NOT need MCP tools (GitHub API, Slack, database queries)

`--fast` maps to `--pure` for OpenCode, skipping external plugins. It is a
no-op for Antigravity, Claude, Codex, Gemini, Ollama, and xAI. Claude intentionally does not
use `--bare` because bare mode skips OAuth/keychain reads and can break
subscription auth.

Most `/phone-a-friend` relay calls are self-contained reviews where the
context is already in the prompt. Default to including `--fast` when the
backend may be OpenCode; it is harmless elsewhere.

## Claude cross-session messaging

When the backend is Claude and the user asks it to coordinate with another
live Claude Code session, report status across sessions, or work autonomously
with peer sessions, use PaF's peer-messaging mode:

```bash
phone-a-friend --to claude --repo "$PWD" \
  --prompt "<prompt>" --peer-messaging accept --session <descriptive-label>
```

Modes:

- `native` (default): expose Claude's `ListAgents` and `SendMessage` tools and
  defer inbound delivery to Claude Code's native permission-mode rules.
- `accept`: expose the peer tools and set `crossSessionInbound` to `accept` so
  a non-interactive worker receives messages without an approval dialog.
- `refuse`: reject inbound messages and remove outbound peer tools.

Peer messaging is Claude-only and requires Claude Code 2.1.224+ on a supported
macOS or Linux setup. PaF fails clearly when `accept` is requested on an older
CLI; `native` degrades to the legacy isolated tool surface. Never pass
`--peer-messaging` to another backend. Prefer a descriptive `--session` label:
PaF exposes it as `paf-<label>` in `/list-agents`; one-shot relays appear as
`paf-relay`. If the user wants unattended peer collaboration routinely, point
them to the one-time setting:

```bash
phone-a-friend config set backends.claude.peer_messaging accept
```

## Multi-backend parallel

When the user asks more than one backend in the same request (e.g. "ask claude and gemini X", "what does codex and ollama think about Y"), run all relays **in parallel**, not sequentially. Sequential calls feel slow even when each one is fast, and a single hung backend should not block the others.

**Quick-question default**: for casual, conversational questions (favourite colour, one-line opinion, sanity check) use `--timeout 60`. The relay's default is 600s, which is correct for code review and bad for "what's your fav colour" — a hung backend can stall the whole interaction. For longer tasks (code review, refactor advice) the default 600s is right; do not lower it.

**Bash pattern** (use this exactly when you have two or more backends to query):

```bash
RELAY_BIN="$(command -v phone-a-friend)"
PROMPT_FILE="$(mktemp)"
trap 'rm -f "$PROMPT_FILE" "$OUT_DIR"/*; rmdir "$OUT_DIR" 2>/dev/null || true' EXIT
OUT_DIR="$(mktemp -d)"

cat > "$PROMPT_FILE" <<'PAF_PROMPT_EOF'
<relay-prompt>
PAF_PROMPT_EOF

# Fire each backend in the background, writing stdout to a per-backend file.
# Apply --no-include-diff for casual questions (no diff payload needed).
for BACKEND in claude gemini; do
  PHONE_A_FRIEND_HOST=<your-host> PHONE_A_FRIEND_INCLUDE_DIFF=false \
    "$RELAY_BIN" --to "$BACKEND" --repo "$PWD" \
      --prompt "$(cat "$PROMPT_FILE")" \
      --no-include-diff --timeout 60 --no-stream \
      > "$OUT_DIR/$BACKEND.out" 2> "$OUT_DIR/$BACKEND.err" &
done
wait
```

After `wait` returns, every backend has either produced output or timed out at 60s. Read each `$OUT_DIR/<backend>.out` (or `.err` if the backend exited non-zero) and **present the results as a compact markdown table**:

```
| Backend | Answer |
|---|---|
| Claude | Blue. |
| Gemini | Electric cyan. |
```

If a backend failed or timed out, surface the error in the table cell so the user sees what happened ("(timed out after 60s)", "(not logged in)") rather than silently dropping that backend.

**Host-specific notes**:
- From Codex: set `PHONE_A_FRIEND_HOST=codex` on every backgrounded call.
- From OpenCode: same with `opencode`.
- From Claude: no host marker required, but the parallel-then-table pattern is the same.
- Never select `--to codex` from Codex or `--to opencode` from OpenCode (the recursion guard refuses).

When waiting on another local Claude session, the main conversation can use
`SendMessage` with `notify_when_idle` if both sessions support it (2.1.236+).
This is a one-shot notice, not proof of task completion; check the final result.
See [Claude peer notifications](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/cross-session-messaging#get-a-notice-when-another-session-goes-idle).

## Background reviews and task tracking

Newer PaF binaries record every relay and review as a task in a local SQLite
store (`~/.config/phone-a-friend/tasks.db`) and print one stderr line when the
run starts:

```text
◇ Task 3f9a2c1d started · phone-a-friend task show 3f9a2c1d
```

Probe once per conversation so stale binaries degrade gracefully:

```bash
if "$RELAY_BIN" task --help >/dev/null 2>&1; then PAF_TASKS=1; else PAF_TASKS=0; fi
```

**Run reviews in the background on the Claude Code host.** A code review can take
minutes; do not block the conversation on it.

1. Preferred: delegate to the plugin subagent `phone-a-friend:paf-reviewer`
   through the Agent tool with `run_in_background: true`, passing the exact
   relay command as the prompt (the same command you would run yourself,
   including the heredoc that writes the prompt file). Do not give it a
   `name`: with agent teams enabled a named subagent becomes a teammate,
   and teammates cannot run background Bash. The review then appears in the
   agent panel and `/tasks`, its verbose output stays out of your context,
   and it returns a receipt plus the verbatim findings when it finishes.
   Fallback when that subagent type is unavailable (older plugin, `-p`
   mode): run the command yourself with the Bash tool's
   `run_in_background: true`.
2. Tell the user the review started and give them the task id in one
   sentence. With the Bash fallback, read the `Task <id> started` line from
   the early output. With the subagent, the id is not visible until it
   reports back, so after a few seconds run
   `"$RELAY_BIN" task list --repo "$PWD" --status running` and quote the
   id from there, for example: "Codex review started (task 3f9a2c1d). I'll
   pick up the result when it finishes; `phone-a-friend task show 3f9a2c1d`
   shows progress from any terminal."
3. Keep working on the user's next request. Do not poll. The host notifies
   you when the background command exits.
4. On completion, read the command output: the relay result is on stdout and
   `Task <id> completed` (or `failed`) is on stderr. Trust that line, not the
   host's exit code: when the command finishes between turns the host may
   report the exit code as unknown or -1 although the relay succeeded. If the
   output is no longer in context, run `"$RELAY_BIN" task result <id>`.
5. If stderr says the working tree changed during the review, say so and
   offer a re-review: the result covers the snapshot captured at start.

Hosts without background shell tasks run the relay synchronously; the task
record is still written and the same `task` commands work.

**Answer shape.** When the review finishes, lead with a one-line receipt
taken from the command output or `"$RELAY_BIN" task show <id>`: task id,
backend, scope, duration, and whether the tree changed during the review.
Then the findings, then the next action. If the user asks how the review is
going, run `task show <id>` and answer with elapsed time and the last
reported event; the background output also carries progress lines
(`◇ 00:12 Running: git diff`), so read that file rather than re-running
anything. Never invent progress the backend did not report. If the user has
the PaF status line configured (`phone-a-friend task status-line`), they can
already see elapsed time and the last event, so keep unprompted chat updates
sparse.

**Finding earlier work.** When the user asks what happened to a review, or
wants to continue one:

```bash
"$RELAY_BIN" task list --repo "$PWD"   # newest first, this repository
"$RELAY_BIN" task show <id>            # scope, backend session, drift check, event log
"$RELAY_BIN" task result <id>          # stored result; exit 3 while still running
```

`task show` includes the backend session id; pass it as `--backend-session`
(or reuse the original `--session` label) to continue that conversation.

**Honesty rules.** A `running` task with no recent events is not proof of a
hang; report elapsed time and the last event. `interrupted` means the owning
PaF process exited without reporting, and the backend may still have finished
on its side. Never claim a result exists until `task result` prints it.

**Retention.** `defaults.task_history = "results" | "metadata" | "off"` (or
`PHONE_A_FRIEND_TASK_HISTORY`); `--no-task-history` skips one run. Prompts are
stored as a 200-character preview plus a hash and diffs as a hash only.
Deleting a task does not delete the backend's own session.

## Session continuity

If this relay is a follow-up to a previous `/phone-a-friend` relay in the
same conversation (e.g., user asked for a review, saw the feedback, and now
wants the same backend to apply fixes or dig deeper), reuse the session:

1. On the **first** relay in a conversation, generate a session ID:
   `paf-<backend>-<short-slug>-<4-char-random>` (e.g.,
   `paf-codex-auth-review-a3f2`). The random suffix prevents collisions
   across repos and conversations.
2. Add `--session <id>` to the relay command.
3. On **subsequent** relays to the **same backend** in the same
   conversation, reuse the same session ID. The backend remembers previous
   turns.
4. If switching backends (e.g., first call to codex, second to ollama),
   generate a new session ID for the new backend. Sessions are
   backend-specific.

Benefits: the backend keeps full conversation history, so follow-up prompts
can be shorter (no need to re-send context from previous turns).

For structured Codex follow-ups, keep passing the requested `--schema` with
`--session` or `--backend-session`. PaF probes resume support and fails clearly
when the selected CLI cannot accept it; never silently remove the schema.
Use `doctor --json` to diagnose PATH/version mismatches before retrying.

**Backend-specific behavior:**
- **Antigravity**: no session support yet. Do not add `--session` or
  `--backend-session` to Antigravity relay calls.
- **Codex, Claude, OpenCode**: native session resume. Follow-up prompts
  can send deltas only.
- **Ollama and xAI**: replay full history each call. Sessions work but prompt
  size grows with each turn. Keep follow-ups concise.
- **Gemini**: native session resume (same as Codex/Claude/OpenCode).
  PaF generates the session UUID client-side, pins it with `--session-id`
  on the first call, and resumes with `--resume` later. Follow-up prompts
  can send deltas only.

On the FIRST relay under a new session label, PaF prints an informational
stderr line: `[phone-a-friend] Session label "..." not found in store.
Starting a fresh session under this label.` This is expected. The hint
about `--backend-session` in that line is for advanced use (see below)
and not relevant to the typical `/phone-a-friend` flow.

**Omit `--session`** for one-off relays where no follow-up is expected.
This is the common case. Only add `--session` when the user explicitly
asks for a follow-up or continuation of a previous relay.

Session continuity is only available in binary mode (`RELAY_MODE = binary`).

### Advanced: `--backend-session` (raw thread ID adoption)

If the user explicitly provides a Codex/Claude/OpenCode backend thread ID
that PaF did not create (e.g., from another tool or a previous CLI run),
attach to it with `--backend-session <id>` instead of `--session <id>`.
Combine with `--session <label>` to also start tracking under a label.

```bash
# Resume a raw backend thread once (no PaF persistence):
phone-a-friend --to codex --repo "$PWD" --backend-session <thread-id> --prompt "<...>" $PAF_NO_DIFF

# Adopt: resume AND start tracking under a PaF label going forward:
phone-a-friend --to codex --repo "$PWD" --session <label> --backend-session <thread-id> --prompt "<...>" $PAF_NO_DIFF
```

This is rarely the right move from inside a Claude Code conversation — the
common case is `--session <label>` with a fresh label. Only use
`--backend-session` when the user supplied a specific backend thread ID.

## Antigravity vs Gemini CLI

Use `--to antigravity` when the user has the Google Antigravity CLI (`agy`)
or a consumer Google subscription path. PaF invokes it in read-only plan
mode with `--sandbox --mode plan --add-dir "$PWD"`.

Use `--to gemini` for Gemini CLI flows that are still valid for the user
(API key, Vertex AI, or enterprise Gemini Code Assist). If Gemini CLI returns
"This client is no longer supported for Gemini Code Assist for individuals",
do not keep retrying Gemini OAuth; suggest Antigravity or API-key/Vertex
Gemini setup.

## Gemini model selection

By default, **omit `--model`** for `--to gemini` and let Gemini CLI's
auto-routing pick the model. This mirrors how `--to codex` and `--to claude`
work in this skill — the CLI's own default is the right default. Pinning
`--model` ages docs poorly; auto-routing tracks deployed models for you.

### When to pin `--model` explicitly

Set `--model` when you need:

- **Reproducibility** — pinning produces deterministic behavior across runs.
- **Capability** — choosing a more capable model for a specific task (e.g.,
  `--model gemini-2.5-pro` for a hard review, accepting more 429s).
- **Debugging** — isolating model behavior from auto-routing changes.

When you do pin and the model returns a strong 404 (`ModelNotFoundError`),
PaF caches the model as unavailable for 24h at
`~/.config/phone-a-friend/gemini-models.json` and surfaces a clear error
that includes the cache path, expiry timestamp, and bypass instructions.
PaF does **not** auto-substitute another model — explicit pins surface
explicit failures so the caller decides whether to retry, switch model,
or omit `--model` and rely on auto-routing.

To bypass the cache (debugging stale entries or testing recovery):

```bash
PHONE_A_FRIEND_GEMINI_DEAD_CACHE=false phone-a-friend --to gemini --model X --prompt "..."
```

Or delete `~/.config/phone-a-friend/gemini-models.json` to clear it.

### Cache scope

- **Cached** (24h): strong 404 (`ModelNotFoundError` from gemini-cli's own classifier).
- **Not cached**: ambiguous 404s (could be a missing project / file, not the model), 429 / RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED, authentication failures, any other error class.
- **Not consulted**: when `--model` is unset (auto-routing), or during session resume (`--resume`).

### Direct Gemini CLI mode (without `phone-a-friend --to gemini`)

When the orchestrator is calling `gemini` directly (no PaF wrapper), the
dead-model cache does NOT apply — the orchestrator is responsible for any
retry. In direct mode, retry rules:

- **Retry**: HTTP 429, 499, 500, 503, 504; RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED; transient/timeout errors.
- **Do NOT retry**: authentication failures, invalid arguments, permission errors, model-not-found.
- **Default**: if an error cannot be confidently classified as transient, surface it immediately.

This does NOT apply to `--to codex` or `--to claude`.

## Notes

- Prefer `--context-text` for small narrative payloads.
- `--context-file` and `--context-text` are mutually exclusive.
- If your narrative context is too large for inline args, write it to a
  temp file outside the repo (e.g. under `/tmp`). Do NOT use a repo-local
  temp file — it muddies git status and risks accidental commit. Repo
  content itself does not need a temp file at all; see "Context hygiene"
  above.

### xAI live research

Use `--to xai` with `XAI_API_KEY` for web and X search (always on).
Default model: `grok-4.6`; override with `--model` or `backends.xai.model`.
Preserve cited `Sources:` URLs; schema mode omits the footer.
